# Icons for app

## About

- `src` should hold raws
- `dist` should hold ready to use

Build script moves `dist` to top level `img`

All prepared in Inkscape.

Not much time was spent on this, something quick and nice was needed thus the icon is a remix of [Orthographic projections and Schlegel diagrams with Hamiltonian cycles of the vertices of the five platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid#/media/File:Hamiltonian_platonic_graphs.svg) by [Cmglee](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Cmglee) orginally licenced under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
